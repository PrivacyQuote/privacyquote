        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Last Updated: September 18, 2025</p>
        <p>PrivacyQuote, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and safeguard your information when you visit our website (privacyquote.com) or use our AI-powered SMS lead nurturing platform. We comply with applicable federal and state laws, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), CAN-SPAM Act, CTIA Messaging Principles, and state mini-TCPAs (e.g., Florida FTSA, Texas Mini-TCPA). This Policy is accessible via a clearly labeled link on our homepage and in all opt-in forms.</p>

        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>We collect information to provide and improve our services, including customized lead nurturing and click-to-call facilitation for licensed insurance agents:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Information</strong>: Data you voluntarily provide, such as name, email address, phone number (including mobile), address, zip code, state of operation, and agency details (e.g., company name, principal contacts) when you register, submit inquiries, or integrate leads via API. For consumers, this may include insurance preferences (e.g., vehicle details) provided with consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Lead Data</strong>: Consumer data (e.g., names, phone numbers) integrated by agents via API, with prior express written consent for SMS/MMS communications per TCPA.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Automatically collected data, including IP address, browser type, device information, operating system, referring URLs, and platform interactions, via cookies and analytics tools to enhance functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Sensitive Information</strong>: We do not collect sensitive data (e.g., Social Security numbers, health, financial details) unless explicitly required for insurance facilitation and with your express consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p>We use your information for legitimate business purposes, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Facilitating Ainsley’s AI-driven SMS/MMS communications with leads, including double opt-in consent confirmation and Click-to-Call connections to agents.</li>
            <li>Providing and improving services, such as platform access, customer support, analytics, and personalized responses via our proprietary AI technologies.</li>
            <li>Communicating via SMS/MMS (see Section 4) and email (see Section 5) with your explicit consent.</li>
            <li>Complying with legal obligations, maintaining TCPA consent records, TCR audit logs, and preventing fraud or misuse.</li>
            <li>Analyzing usage trends to enhance Site functionality and user experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your information for automated decision-making that produces legal effects or similarly significant impacts.</p>

        <h3>3. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or share lead data beyond facilitating one-to-one connections between agents and their leads. We may share information with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: Third-party vendors (e.g., SMS platforms like Twilio) under strict confidentiality agreements to support platform operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Authorities</strong>: As required by law (e.g., subpoenas) or to protect our rights, safety, or property.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale, your data may be transferred with notice and consent where required.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. SMS/MMS Communications</h3>
        <p>If you provide your mobile number and explicitly opt in (e.g., via a non-pre-checked box on our forms), you consent to receive automated SMS/MMS messages from PrivacyQuote’s AI assistant, Ainsley, regarding lead nurturing, platform updates, or click-to-call invitations. All messaging complies with TCPA requirements for prior express written consent, CTIA principles, and state mini-TCPAs (e.g., Florida FTSA, Texas Mini-TCPA):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opt-In Details</strong>: Consent is obtained via clear language, e.g., “By checking this box and providing my mobile number, I expressly consent to receive automated SMS/MMS messages from PrivacyQuote about lead nurturing and platform updates. Message and data rates may apply. Reply STOP to opt out, HELP for info.”</li>
            <li><strong>Double Opt-In</strong>: Recipients must confirm consent (e.g., “Reply YES to continue”).</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out</strong>: Immediate opt-out by replying “STOP”; we maintain an internal suppression list.</li>
            <li><strong>Message Frequency</strong>: Varies but typically 10-15 messages per interaction; standard rates apply.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Restrictions</strong>: Messages are limited to insurance-related inquiries (e.g., discounts, vehicle details) and comply with CTIA’s prohibited content guidelines (e.g., no spam, high-risk content).</li>
            <li><strong>Reasonable Hours</strong>: Messages sent 9 AM-8 PM local time, except in active, consumer-initiated conversations.</li>
            <li><strong>DNC Compliance</strong>: We honor federal and state Do Not Call lists; agents must verify leads are not on DNC lists before integration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See our <a href="sms-compliance.html">SMS Compliance Page</a> for full details.</p>

        <h3>5. Email Communications</h3>
        <p>If you opt in, you consent to receive commercial emails under the CAN-SPAM Act. Emails include an unsubscribe link and our postal address (1225 N Willow Ave., Suite 100, Clovis, CA 93619). We do not send unsolicited emails.</p>

        <h3>6. Data Security</h3>
        <p>We implement industry-standard measures, including encryption, access controls, secure servers, and fraud detection, to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Despite these efforts, no system is completely secure, and you use our services at your own risk. We notify affected users and authorities of breaches as required by law.</p>

        <h3>7. Your Rights</h3>
        <p>Under CCPA and similar state laws, you may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request access to, correction, or deletion of your personal information.</li>
            <li>Opt out of data sales (we do not sell data).</li>
            <li>Limit use of sensitive personal information.</li>
            <li>Request non-discrimination for exercising your rights.</li>

        <h3>8. Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>Our services are designed exclusively for licensed insurance agents and are not intended for individuals under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
