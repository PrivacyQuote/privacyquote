        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>PrivacyQuote, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and safeguard your information when you visit our website (privacyquote.com) or use our AI-powered SMS lead nurturing platform. We comply with applicable laws, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), CAN-SPAM Act, and CTIA Messaging Principles, to ensure ethical data handling and messaging practices. This Policy is easily accessible via a clearly labeled link on our homepage and in all opt-in forms.</p>

        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>We collect information to provide and improve our services, including customized data leads, warm transfers, verified click-to-call, telemarketing, and insurance lead facilitation.</p>
        <p>This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Information</strong>: Data you voluntarily provide, such as your name, email address, phone number (including mobile number), address, zip code, insurance preferences, and other details when you fill out forms on our Site or request insurance quotes. This may include demographic information relevant to insurance inquiries (e.g., age, vehicle details for auto insurance) or agency details (e.g., company name, principal contacts).</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>: Automatically collected data, such as your IP address, browser type, device information, operating system, referring URLs, and usage patterns, to enhance Site functionality and user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</strong>: Our Site uses cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to remember preferences, analyze trends, and improve services. These do not track mobile data for SMS purposes. You can manage cookies via your browser settings or opt out, though this may limit features. We do not collect sensitive personal information (e.g., Social Security numbers, health data) unless explicitly required for insurance facilitation and with your consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p>We use your information for legitimate business purposes, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To process your insurance inquiries, send lead notifications, and facilitate click-to-call connections to licensed insurance agents.</li>
            <li>To provide and improve our services, such as customizing responses to your requests, including through our proprietary AI technologies that generate responses and facilitate conversations based on your questions and interactions.</li>
            <li>To communicate with you, including via SMS/MMS (see SMS Communications section below) and email (see Email Communications section below).</li>
            <li>To send updates, promotions, or informational content related to insurance options, but only with your explicit opt-in consent.</li>
            <li>To analyze usage and trends for internal business improvements.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal obligations, prevent fraud, enforce our policies, or respond to legal requests (e.g., subpoenas).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your information for automated decision-making that produces legal effects or similarly significant impacts.</p>

        <h3>3. SMS/MMS Communications</h3>
        <p>If you provide your mobile number and explicitly opt in (e.g., by checking a non-pre-checked box on our forms), you consent to receive automated SMS/MMS messages from PrivacyQuote regarding your insurance inquiries, lead updates, or click-to-call invitations. We use our proprietary AI technologies to generate responses and facilitate conversations, tailoring messages based on your questions and interactions. All messaging complies with TCPA requirements for prior express written consent and CTIA principles for ethical, non-spammy communications, including content monitoring, feedback loops, and adherence to best practices for message content and frequency. We honor national DNC lists and send messages only during reasonable hours (9 AM-8 PM local time), except for responses in active, consumer-initiated conversations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opt-In Details</strong>: Consent is obtained via clear, conspicuous language on forms, such as: “By checking this box and providing my mobile number, I expressly consent to receive automated SMS/MMS messages from PrivacyQuote about insurance options, lead updates, and click-to-call invitations. Message and data rates may apply. Reply STOP to opt out, HELP for info.”</li>
            <li><strong>Double Opt-In</strong>: Recipients must confirm consent (e.g., “Reply YES to continue”).</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out</strong>: Immediate opt-out available by replying “STOP” to any message.</li>
            <li><strong>Message Frequency</strong>: Varies but typically 10 - 15 messages per interaction; standard message and data rates may apply.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Restrictions</strong>: Messages are limited to insurance-related inquiries (e.g., discounts, vehicle details) and comply with CTIA’s prohibited content guidelines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Email Communications</h3>
        <p>If you opt in, you consent to receive commercial emails under the CAN-SPAM Act. Emails include an unsubscribe link and your postal address. We do not send unsolicited emails.</p>

        <h3>5. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or share lead data beyond facilitating one-to-one connections between agents and their leads. We may share information with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: Third-party vendors (e.g., SMS platforms like Twilio) under strict confidentiality agreements to support platform operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Authorities</strong>: As required by law, such as in response to subpoenas or to protect our rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale, your data may be transferred with notice and consent where required.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Data Security</h3>
        <p>We implement industry-standard measures, including encryption, access controls, and secure servers, to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Despite these efforts, no system is completely secure, and you use our services at your own risk. We notify affected users and authorities of breaches as required by law.</p>

        <h3>7. Your Rights</h3>
        <p>Under CCPA and similar state laws, you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access, correct, or delete your personal information.</li>
            <li>Opt out of data sales (we do not sell data).</li>
            <li>Limit use of sensitive personal information.</li>
            <li>Non-discrimination for exercising your rights.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Submit requests to <a href="mailto:support@privacyquote.com">support@privacyquote.com</a>. We respond within 45 days, per CCPA requirements. For CCPA, we do not sell data and do not share for cross-context behavioral advertising.</p>

        <h3>8. Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>Our services are designed exclusively for licensed insurance agents and are not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it immediately. Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@privacyquote.com">support@privacyquote.com</a> or 866-580-7552 if you believe we have inadvertently collected such data.</p>

        <h3>9. Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Updates will be posted here with a revised effective date. Continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
