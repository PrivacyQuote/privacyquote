        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Effective Date: September 16, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>PrivacyQuote (“we,” “our,” “us,” or “Company”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website at <a href="https://privacyquote.com">https://privacyquote.com</a> (the “Site”), submit forms for insurance inquiries, upload leads as an insurance agent, or interact with our services, including SMS/MMS messaging powered by AI for lead engagement and click-to-call facilitation. By using our Site or services, you consent to the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use our Site or provide your information.</p>
        <p>We comply with applicable laws, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), National Do Not Call Registry (DNC), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)/California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), CAN-SPAM Act, CTIA Messaging Principles and Best Practices, and The Campaign Registry (TCR) requirements for SMS verification and compliance. This Policy is designed to support TCR approval for toll-free SMS messaging, emphasizing explicit opt-in processes, double opt-in confirmation, clear opt-out mechanisms, message frequency disclosures, and adherence to low-risk use cases such as "Customer Care" for AI-driven conversational messaging. This Policy is easily accessible via a clearly labeled link in the footer of every page on our Site, as well as in all opt-in forms and agent dashboards.</p>

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>We collect information to provide and improve our services, which enable insurance agents to engage their own SMS-opted-in leads (purchased from third-party providers) using our AI-powered platform for conversational SMS and click-to-call connections.</p>
        <p>This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Information</strong>: Data you voluntarily provide, such as your name, email address, phone number (including mobile number), address, zip code, insurance preferences, and other details when you fill out forms on our Site or request insurance quotes as a consumer. For insurance agents, this includes agency details (e.g., company name, principal contacts) and lead data you upload (e.g., consumer names, phone numbers, and preferences from your purchased leads). This may include demographic information relevant to insurance inquiries (e.g., age, vehicle details for auto insurance).</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>: Automatically collected data, such as your IP address, browser type, device information, operating system, referring URLs, and usage patterns, to enhance Site functionality and user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</strong>: Our Site uses cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to remember preferences, analyze trends, and improve services. These do not track mobile data for SMS purposes. You can manage cookies via your browser settings or opt out, though this may limit features. We do not collect sensitive personal information (e.g., Social Security numbers, health data) unless explicitly required for insurance facilitation and with your consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We only collect lead data provided by agents who confirm prior SMS opt-in consent from consumers and compliance with federal and state DNC lists. We do not generate or sell leads ourselves.</p>

        <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p>We use your information for legitimate business purposes, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate AI-powered SMS conversations for lead qualification, where our proprietary AI technologies generate responses and engage consumers based on their questions and interactions.</li>
            <li>To process agent-uploaded leads, send lead notifications, and enable click-to-call connections to licensed insurance agents.</li>
            <li>To provide and improve our services, such as customizing responses and ensuring compliant communications.</li>
            <li>To communicate with you, including via SMS/MMS (see SMS Communications section below), email (see Email Communications section below), and phone calls.</li>
            <li>To send updates, promotions, or informational content related to insurance options, but only with your explicit opt-in consent.</li>
            <li>To respond to agency requests, manage accounts, and provide platform services.</li>
            <li>To analyze usage and trends for internal business improvements.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal obligations, prevent fraud, enforce our policies, or respond to legal requests (e.g., subpoenas, TCR audits).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your information for automated decision-making that produces legal effects or similarly significant impacts. All uses align with TCR guidelines for registered campaigns, ensuring no prohibited content (e.g., high-risk financial services, spam).</p>

        <h3>SMS/MMS Communications</h3>
        <p>If you provide your mobile number and explicitly opt in (e.g., by checking a non-pre-checked box on our forms or replying "YES" during double opt-in), you consent to receive automated SMS/MMS messages from PrivacyQuote regarding your insurance inquiries, lead engagement, or click-to-call invitations. We use our proprietary AI technologies to generate responses and facilitate conversations, tailoring messages based on your questions and interactions. All messaging complies with TCPA requirements for prior express written consent, including disclosures about automated systems (e.g., automatic telephone dialing systems or ATDS) and artificial/pre-recorded voices where applicable. We adhere to CTIA Messaging Principles for ethical, non-spammy communications, including content monitoring, feedback loops, and best practices for message content and frequency. For TCR approval and compliance, our campaigns are registered under low-risk use cases like "Customer Care," with vetted business details, explicit opt-in workflows, and message samples provided during registration.</p>
        <p>Agents are solely responsible for ensuring uploaded leads are not listed on the federal DNC or state equivalents (e.g., Texas, Florida, Michigan). PrivacyQuote does not perform DNC scrubbing but requires agents to verify compliance and maintain records.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opt-In Details</strong>: Consent is obtained via clear, conspicuous language on forms or initial texts, such as: "By providing your mobile number and checking this box, you provide prior express written consent to receive up to 15 automated SMS/MMS messages per interaction from PrivacyQuote about insurance leads, including AI-generated responses and click-to-call links. Message and data rates may apply. This is not a condition of purchase. Reply HELP for help, STOP to opt out." For agent-uploaded leads, we require agents to confirm prior opt-in, and we perform a double opt-in at the start of conversations (e.g., "Reply YES to confirm interest in insurance quotes and continue this AI chat. Msg&data rates apply. STOP to opt out.").</li>
            <li><strong>Message Frequency and Samples</strong>: Frequency varies but is limited to 10-15 messages per interaction. Examples:
                <ul>
                    <li>Opt-In Confirmation: "Reply YES to discuss your insurance needs with our AI assistant. Msg&data rates may apply. Reply STOP to opt out."</li>
                    <li>AI Interaction: "What type of insurance are you interested in? Auto, home, or life?"</li>
                    <li>Click-to-Call: "Based on your responses, click here [link] to connect with your agent."</li>
                    <li>Opt-Out Confirmation: "You have been unsubscribed. No more messages will be sent. Reply START to re-subscribe."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out and Support</strong>: Reply "STOP" to any message to opt out immediately—we honor this within 5 minutes. Reply "HELP" for support or more info. You can also opt out by contacting us (see Contact section). Opting out of SMS does not affect other communications unless specified.</li>
            <li><strong>TCR Compliance</strong>: Our toll-free numbers are registered with TCR, including business verification (e.g., EIN, DUNS for 2026 requirements), use case descriptions ("Customer Care" for lead qualification), opt-in screenshots, and message samples. We maintain records of consents for audits and comply with carrier pass-through fees and throughput limits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Email Communications</h3>
        <p>We may send emails for transactional purposes (e.g., confirmations) or marketing (with opt-in). All emails comply with the CAN-SPAM Act, including accurate headers, physical address, and clear opt-out links. To unsubscribe from marketing emails, click the link in any email or contact us—we process within 10 business days. Transactional emails (e.g., lead updates) are exempt from opt-out but can be managed via account settings.</p>

        <h3>Sharing Your Information</h3>
        <p>We share your information only as necessary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With licensed insurance agents for one-to-one lead engagement (no shared or sold leads).</li>
            <li>With service providers (e.g., SMS platforms like Twilio) bound by confidentiality and TCR compliance.</li>
            <li>As required by law, such as TCPA investigations or DNC enforcement.</li>
            <li>In business transfers (e.g., mergers), with notice to you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information as defined under CCPA/CPRA or similar laws. In the past 12 months, we have not sold any personal information.</p>

        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        <p>We implement reasonable security measures (e.g., encryption, access controls) to protect your data from unauthorized access or breaches. However, no system is infallible—notify us immediately of suspected issues.</p>

        <h3>Your Rights and Choices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access, Correction, Deletion</strong>: Request access to, correction of, or deletion of your data by contacting us.</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing</strong>: We do not sell or share data for cross-context behavioral advertising, but you can opt out via "Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information" link on our Site.</li>
            <li><strong>CCPA/CPRA Rights (for California Residents)</strong>: Rights to know, delete, correct, opt-out of sales/sharing, limit sensitive data use, and non-discrimination. We verify requests via email/phone confirmation. Agents may submit on your behalf with authorization.</li>
            <li><strong>Other State Rights</strong>: Similar rights under Virginia CDPA, Colorado CPA, Connecticut CTDPA, Utah UCPA—contact us to exercise.</li>
            <li><strong>DNC and TCPA</strong>: Register with national DNC at donotcall.gov; agents must ensure leads are not on DNC lists before uploading to our platform.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>Our services are not for children under 13 (or 16 in some jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect their data—contact us to delete if collected inadvertently.</p>

        <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Policy, with changes posted here and effective immediately. For material changes, we notify via email/SMS or Site banner. Continued use constitutes acceptance.</p>
