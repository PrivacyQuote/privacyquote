        <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
        <p>Last Updated: September 24, 2025</p>
        <p>Welcome to PrivacyQuote. These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of our agent-facing website and SaaS platform, including our AI-powered SMS lead nurturing platform, Ainsley, designed exclusively for licensed insurance agents. We do not collect consumer data directly; consumer data is provided by integrated vendors for SMS nurturing. By accessing or using our services, you irrevocably agree to these Terms, forming a legally binding contract. If you do not agree, do not use our services.</p>
        <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>Your use of our services constitutes unconditional acceptance of these Terms, our <a href="https://privacyquote.github.io/privacyquote/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, and <a href="https://privacyquote.github.io/privacyquote/sms-compliance.html">SMS Compliance Page</a>. For agents, acceptance is also confirmed via electronic signature in partnership agreements or continued use after updates, with acknowledgment required within 5 business days via signed addendum. Consumer data is processed only through vendor-provided Prior Express Written Consent (PEWC) and our mandatory second opt-in verification (“Reply YES”). Failure to comply constitutes a material breach subject to termination.</p>
        <h3>2. Eligibility</h3>
        <p>Our services are exclusively for licensed insurance agents or their authorized representatives, aged 18 or older. Our website does not collect consumer data; Ainsley uses vendor-provided consumer data (e.g., phone number, name) with PEWC for SMS nurturing. We do not collect data from individuals under 13, ensuring compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>
        <h3>3. Use of Services</h3>
        <p><strong>For Agents</strong>: PrivacyQuote enables licensed insurance agents to nurture vendor-purchased consumer leads using Ainsley’s AI-powered SMS platform, registered with Twilio for toll-free conversational messaging. You must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide accurate agent information (e.g., name, email, phone, primary office state) in forms and integrations, selecting your primary office state for compliance with state mini-TCPA laws.</li>
            <li>Ensure consumer leads are sourced from vendors with verified PEWC and scrubbed against National and State Do Not Call Registries.</li>
            <li>Use Ainsley only for lawful purposes, prohibiting unauthorized messaging, harassment, or non-compliant activities.</li>
            <li>Utilize the Click-to-Call feature to connect consumers to agents, ensuring compliance with TCPA and mini-TCPA call frequency limits (max 3 attempts in 24 hours).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For Consumer Lead Nurturing</strong>: Ainsley uses vendor-provided consumer data (e.g., phone number, name) to send conversational SMS, offering click-to-call options to connect with agents. We require vendor PEWC and add a second opt-in via SMS (“Reply YES”).</p>
        <p>Prohibited uses include sending unsolicited messages, violating TCPA/CTIA/mini-TCPA laws, or using consumer data directly via our website.</p>
        <h3>4. SMS Communication Terms</h3>
        <p><strong>For Agents</strong>: By submitting forms, you provide PEWC for automated SMS/MMS from Ainsley or our support team, up to 30 messages per session, within permitted hours per your selected state (e.g., 8 a.m.–8 p.m. for most mini-TCPA states).</p>
        <p><strong>For Consumer Leads</strong>: Ainsley sends conversational SMS to nurture vendor-provided leads, limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opt-In</strong>: Vendor PEWC plus our second opt-in (“Reply YES”).</li>
            <li><strong>Message Frequency</strong>: Up to 30 messages per session, sent only within permitted hours (e.g., 8 a.m.–8 p.m. for Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin; 9 a.m.–9 p.m. weekdays for Texas, no texts after 12 p.m. Sundays; 8 a.m.–8 p.m. for Washington’s CEMA, RCW 19.190).</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out</strong>: Consumers can reply “STOP” to opt out immediately, with records retained for 5 years per TCPA.</li>
            <li><strong>Content</strong>: SMS includes click-to-call options to connect consumers with agents for quotes.</li>
            <li><strong>Message and Data Rates</strong>: Standard rates may apply. Reply “HELP” for assistance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not support uploaded consumer data; only real-time vendor integrations with verified PEWC are permitted.</p>
        <h3>5. Agent Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>

Stat. § 501.059), Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas (Bus. & Com. Code § 305), Utah, Virginia, Washington (CEMA, RCW 19.190), and Wisconsin.</li>
            <li>Maintaining PEWC documentation and DNC compliance for all leads.</li>

        <h3>10. Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p>Disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration under the American Arbitration Association (AAA) Commercial Arbitration Rules in Clovis, California, before a single arbitrator with telecommunications expertise. Class actions, consolidated arbitrations, or appeals are prohibited. The prevailing party recovers reasonable attorney fees, costs, and interest at the maximum legal rate. This clause survives termination and is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
        <h3>11. Governing Law</h3>
        <p>These Terms are governed by California law, without regard to conflict of law principles. Non-arbitration actions must be brought in state or federal courts in Fresno County, California, where you consent to jurisdiction and waive objections to venue.</p>
        <h3>12. Termination</h3>
        <p>We may terminate your access immediately for violations (e.g., non-compliance, unauthorized messaging), with no notice required. Termination includes account disabling, toll-free number revocation, fee forfeiture as liquidated damages, and pursuit of legal remedies (e.g., damages up to $1,500 per violation). Post-termination notice is provided within 24 hours, with a 10-day appeal period at our discretion.</p>

        <h3>14. Severability</h3>
        <p>If any provision is unenforceable, it shall be severed, and the remaining provisions remain in effect, reformed to uphold the original intent.</p>
        <h3>15. Entire Agreement</h3>
