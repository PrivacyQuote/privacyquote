        <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
        <p>Effective Date: September 18, 2025</p>
        <p>By accessing, browsing, or using the PrivacyQuote website located at privacyquote.com (the "Site"), our services (including but not limited to AI-powered SMS lead nurturing and click-to-call facilitation), or any content, materials, features, or functionalities available through the Site (collectively, the "Services" and "Content"), you ("User," "you," or "your") agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"), our Privacy Policy, and any other rules, policies, or guidelines published on the Site or incorporated herein by reference. These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and PrivacyQuote, Inc., a California corporation, including its affiliates, agents, successors, and assigns.</p>
        <p>If you do not agree to these Terms, you must immediately cease all access to and use of the Site, Services, and Content. Your continued use constitutes your unconditional acceptance of these Terms, without any reservations, representations, or warranties. You represent and warrant that: (i) you are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction and capable of forming a legally binding contract; (ii) you have the full authority to bind yourself (or the entity you represent) to these Terms; (iii) your use of the Site, Services, and Content complies with all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws, regulations, and industry standards, including but not limited to data privacy, consumer protection, and communications laws; and (iv) you will not use the Site, Services, or Content for any unlawful or prohibited purpose.</p>
        <p>These Terms include important provisions regarding dispute resolution through binding arbitration (Section 7), limitations on liability (Section 8), indemnity obligations (Section 10), and your consent to electronic communications, including text messages (SMS/MMS) where applicable (Section 6). We reserve the right to refuse access to the Site or Services to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>

        <h3>1. Services Overview</h3>
        <p>The Site serves as a business-to-business (B2B) platform connecting licensed insurance agents ("Agents" or "Partners") with consumer leads seeking insurance quotes. Through our Services, Agents may integrate their lead vendors via API for real-time lead delivery, and Ainsley, our AI assistant, facilitates “warm transfers" by engaging leads in compliant SMS conversations to qualify interests and encourage Click-to-Call connections.</p>
        <p>We are not an insurance provider, broker, agent, or carrier. We do not sell, underwrite, or administer insurance policies or products. We do not endorse, recommend, or guarantee any insurance policy, coverage, quote, or outcome. We provide no financial, legal, or insurance advice. All interactions between Agents and consumers are solely between those parties, and we act solely as an independent contractor facilitating the transfer of leads. We are not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, or legality of any information provided by consumers or Agents, nor for any disputes arising from such interactions.</p>
        <p>If you are a consumer interacting with our Services (e.g., receiving SMS from Ainsley), these Terms apply to you, but please also review our Privacy Policy for details on how we handle your personal information. Consumers should note that by responding to messages, you consent to continued engagement, subject to applicable laws.</p>

        <h3>2. Accessing Our Site and Services</h3>
        <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the Site, Services, and Content solely for your internal, legitimate business purposes related to inquiring about or using our SMS lead nurturing platform (if you are an Agent) or engaging with lead communications (if you are a consumer). This license does not include any right to: (i) resell, distribute, or commercially exploit the Site, Services, or Content; (ii) modify, adapt, or create derivative works from the Content; (iii) use any data mining, robots, spiders, or similar automated data gathering or extraction tools; or (iv) frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other proprietary information without our express written consent.</p>
        <p>All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by us, including all intellectual property rights in the Site, Services, and Content. You acknowledge that the Site and Services may contain proprietary and confidential information protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws.</p>
        <p>We may, at our sole discretion, modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Site or Services at any time, with or without notice. You agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation.</p>

        <h3>3. User Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>As an Agent or user, you agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lead Compliance</strong>: Ensure all leads have prior express written consent for SMS/MMS communications per TCPA and CTIA guidelines. Verify leads are not on federal or state Do Not Call (DNC) lists before integration. You are solely responsible for your leads' compliance.</li>
            <li><strong>Accurate Information</strong>: Provide accurate and complete information when registering or using our platform, including valid contact details and lead data. You represent that you have the authority to provide such information.</li>
            <li><strong>Prohibited Use</strong>: Not use the Services for unlawful purposes, to send unsolicited messages, to violate any federal or state regulations (including mini-TCPAs like Florida FTSA or Texas Mini-TCPA), or to engage in fraudulent activities. You will not upload leads without consent or use the platform for spam.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration Compliance</strong>: When integrating lead vendors via API, ensure your vendors comply with all applicable laws and obtain necessary consents.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. SMS Communications</h3>
        <p>If you opt in, you consent to receive automated SMS/MMS messages from PrivacyQuote regarding your account, lead updates, or platform notifications. All messaging complies with TCPA requirements for prior express written consent and CTIA principles for ethical communications. We honor DNC lists and send messages during reasonable hours (9 AM-8 PM local time).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opt-In</strong>: Consent is obtained via clear language, such as: “By checking this box and providing my mobile number, I expressly consent to receive automated SMS/MMS messages from PrivacyQuote about platform updates and lead integration. Message and data rates may apply. Reply STOP to opt out, HELP for info.”</li>
            <li><strong>Double Opt-In</strong>: For lead engagement, recipients confirm consent (e.g., “Reply YES to continue”).</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out</strong>: Immediate opt-out by replying “STOP.”</li>
            <li><strong>Frequency</strong>: Varies but typically 10 - 15 messages per interaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>All content, software, and trademarks on the Site and Services, including Ainsley’s AI technology, are owned by PrivacyQuote, Inc. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works without written permission. Your use grants us a limited license to your uploaded lead data for the Services.</p>

        <h3>6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>The Site, Services, and Content are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE," without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We disclaim all warranties, including for accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of Content. We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, including lost profits, data loss, or third-party claims. Our liability is limited to the amount you paid for the Services in the 12 months preceding the claim. You use the Services at your own risk, and we are not responsible for Agent-consumer interactions or lead quality.</p>

        <h3>7. Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p>Any disputes arising from these Terms shall be resolved through binding arbitration in Fresno County, California, under the American Arbitration Association's rules. You waive the right to class actions or jury trials. Governing law is California, without regard to conflicts of laws principles.</p>

        <h3>8. Indemnity</h3>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold PrivacyQuote, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Services, violation of these Terms, or violation of any law, including TCPA non-compliance or DNC violations related to your leads.</p>

        <h3>9. Termination</h3>
        <p>We may terminate your access for violating these Terms, including non-compliance with TCPA or uploading invalid leads. You may terminate by contacting us. Upon termination, your right to use the Services ends immediately.</p>
