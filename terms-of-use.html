        <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
        <p>Last Updated: September 22, 2025</p>
        <p>Welcome to PrivacyQuote. By accessing, using, or integrating with our website, SaaS platform, or services, including our AI-powered SMS lead nurturing platform and AI assistant, Ainsley, you irrevocably agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). These Terms are designed to provide robust legal protections, ensure compliance with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), state mini-TCPA laws (e.g., Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin), the National Do Not Call Registry (DNC), and CTIA guidelines, and facilitate toll-free texting approval. These Terms form a legally binding contract. If you do not agree, do not use our services.</p>

        <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>Your use of our services constitutes unconditional acceptance of these Terms, our <a href="https://privacyquote.github.io/privacyquote/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, and <a href="https://privacyquote.github.io/privacyquote/sms-compliance.html">SMS Compliance Page</a>. For agent partners, acceptance is also confirmed via electronic signature in partnership agreements or continued use after updates, with acknowledgment required within 5 business days via signed addendum. For consumers, acceptance occurs through your opt-in consent via vendor processes and our mandatory second opt-in verification. Failure to comply constitutes a material breach subject to termination.</p>

        <h3>2. Eligibility</h3>
        <p>Our services are exclusively for licensed insurance agents and consumers 18 years or older. We do not collect data from individuals under 13, ensuring compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

        <h3>3. Use of Services</h3>
        <p><strong>For Agent Partners</strong>: Our platform enables licensed insurance agents to nurture real-time, opt-in consumers from integrated vendors using Ainsley. You must:</p>

            <li>Ensure consumers are sourced from vendors with verified Prior Express Written Consent (PEWC) for SMS and DNC compliance.</li>
            <li>Use the platform only for lawful purposes, prohibiting unauthorized messaging, harassment, or non-compliant activities.</li>
            <li>Utilize the Click-to-Call feature properly, avoiding unsolicited calls.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For Consumers</strong>: Your data is processed solely to facilitate nurturing by agents via Ainsley, based on your vendor-provided first opt-in and our mandatory second opt-in verification.</p>

        <h3>4. SMS Communication Terms</h3>

            <li><strong>Opt-Out</strong>: Reply STOP to opt out immediately. Opt-outs are logged and added to our DNC list.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance</strong>: We adhere to TCPA, CTIA, and mini-TCPA laws in Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin, including time restrictions (e.g., 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., except Texas: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays, no texts after 12 p.m. Sundays), call frequency limits (3 attempts in 24 hours), and opt-out requirements.</li>

        </ul>
